> Welcome to Elxiki!
| This is an imitation of http://xiki.org, written in pure
| emacs lisp. Use `elxiki-command' (C-<return>) to do
| a context-aware action at point. Try it on the + line
| following:
- Introduction:
  - Kinds of lines:
    | Elxiki organizes things by line. Each line is split up
    | into a 'prefix' and 'name'. Different prefixes do
    | different things when acted upon, listed below. Elxiki
    | recognizes any line that starts with one of these
    | prefixes or that ends with a /.
    |
    | > is a Heading
    > Like This
    |
    | | is arbitrary text
    | As you've been seeing.
    |
    | + and - are opened and closed folders.
    + Open Me
      | And close me again.
    |
    | @ Opens a menu by name.
    @ menu/
    |
    | ! evaluates elisp code.
    ! load-path
    |
    | !! evaluates elisp code, but doesn't print the output.
    !! (describe-function 'elxiki-mode)
    |
    | $ Runs a shell command.
    $ ls -la /
    |
    | % Runs a shell command asynchronously.
    % top
    |
    | & Finds a file. C-u to open in another window,
    | C-u C-u to open in another frame.
    & /home
  + Directories:
    | You can also open directories. Elxiki sees anything
    | starting with /, ~, or . as a directory. Lines under
    | a directory are run from that directory:
    - /home/
      ! default-directory
      $ pwd
    | And of course, they work with tramp:
    | + /ssh:user@remote:~/
  @ filtering
  | That's all for now!
  | Woosh:
  @ zone

ElXiKi
======

Inspired by [Xiki](http://xiki.org), but this time implemented in elisp.

Xiki is really nice, but it (a) has a ton of extra dependencies, and
(b) overwrites a lot of emacs's defaults. Here's my attempt writing at
some of the easier to implement features in emacs lisp while following
(more of) the emacs style guidelines.

This is nowhere near being done.

Features
--------

Right now there's only really basic stuff.

At point, you can:

* Fold/Unfold a directory.
  * Works with tramp too.
* Run synchronous and asynchronous commands.
  * Also in subdirectories.
* Run elisp.
* Open files.
* Open menus.
  * Have specific menu items run arbitrary code.

Installation
------------

Just require elxiki:

    (add-to-list 'load-path "the/elxiki/folder/")
    (require 'elxiki)

To get started, open up a buffer (*scratch* works fine), run 
`M-x elxiki-mode`, goto a new line, type `elxiki/`, and hit
`C-<return>`.

Usage
-----

Just `M-x elxiki-mode`, and then use `elxiki-command` (bound by
default to `C-<return>` and `M-<return>`) to do things.

#### Open a directory:

Type a directory name on a new line starting with "~", ".", or "/" and
ending with "/". Then you can open/close it with `elxiki-command`.

#### Run a shell command:

Any line starting with "$ " will run as a shell command inline. "% "
Can be used for asynchronous commands. If the lines are indented below
a directory, they are run as if they were in that directory.

#### Run emacs lisp:
"! " lines will run emacs lisp commands inline.

#### Menus:

"@ " or prefixless lines will open up menus, if you have them
defined. The all/ menu lists all menus.

Stuff To Add
------------

* Saving menus.
* Work on windows, etc.
* Grep menus after opening.
* Comment prefixes.
